JAVASCRIPT GAME LAB PART 2 - FUNCTIONS

Task: Expand on the game by adding functions that allow the user to start the game and get a number to use as damage.

Functions:
Rearrange your code to include these functions.
1. startGamefunction. Thisfunction will:
  a. Prompt the user if they would like to play, and if they say yes...
    i. Allow the user to enter the character’s name.
    ii. Call the startCombat function.
2. startCombatfunction. Whenexecuted,thiswillruntheentireloopyoucreatedinPart One.
3. getDamage function. This will return a number between 1 and 5 that will be used to decide how much damage the user and Grant will deal each round.

Additional Changes:
1. Each iteration of the loop will include a prompt that will ask the user if they would like to “attack” or “quit”.
2. If the user decides to attack, adjust the character’s health points and Grant’s health points based on the getDamage function.
3. If the user decides to quit, figure out a way to exit out of the loop and function.
